tool flow notes:

testbench files must be named tb.v
test bench can include extra commands for reading from text file
make help for info from each Makefile before running actual makes
$DESIGN parameter must be passed to make design and make link commands (ex. make DESIGN=fsm design)
link commands does all softlinks not asked for by make help

for each Makefile, run 'make help' to see what to do, run 'make DESIGN=<name> link' for automatic softlinks, run 'make DESIGN=<name> design to run mainsapr/simulation
